							<!-- UPDATE BLOG CONTENT BELOW -->

							<p class="headline">At NewFront, you’ll be participating in a panel discussing the way in which digital technology has transformed content and publishing. Can you give us a sneak preview of the things you’re most keen to talk about?</p>

							<p>I’m not sure that accelerated interaction with each other, brands and information is actually good for our health and wellbeing. I’m an easily distracted person - one of the reason I started Sabotage was to just serve up interesting and subtracting articles and videos, it just pre-dated the rise of Twitter. Had Twitter come first I might not have ever done the website - and I’ve been hooked on various digital offerings, from online Scrabble 5 years ago to using Twitter as a search engine. Really addicted. Recently my iPhone broke and I had it fixed by a small company in the countryside where I was staying. It broke again almost immediately and Apple wouldn’t fix it because someone else had. The first time I was without it for a few days I’d quite liked it. So when they wouldn’t give me a new one I just thought ‘fuck it’.</p>

							<p>The change in my life has been huge. I’ve now got a very simple £10 Nokia. The battery lasts for a week. If I drop it the battery comes out but the screen doesn’t smash. I receive phone calls and texts. It’s created a barrier between me and the internet and I feel really, really good. I’m rarely that far away from a laptop, mine or someone else’s, so the cut off after the first couple of days isn’t that bad.</p>

							<p>I don’t have a camera which is a pity and I can’t access certain information like train times or locations immediately. But I’ve found myself using the giant street maps on the wall of every tube station.</p>

							<p>My mental state is much, much calmer not constantly plugging into this instantly over-stimulating network. I answer emails in a more organised and productive way. I find it easier to control my time and what content I am consuming.</p>

							<p>I’m spending more time on social media on my laptop but in general I’m much more aware of where I am and what’s going on.</p>

							<p>And you know what, once you step outside you see a form of physical madness. people riding pushbikes in front of lorries looking at phones. People stood in the middle of roads at junctions looking at phones. people posting pictures of themselves on Facebook with bruises and cuts from walking into lamp-posts.</p>

							<p>And guess what. I missed one piece of work worth £150 that I would have liked to do. New technology is supposed to make our lives better but I don’t think it does anymore.</p>

							<p class="headline">2) What three technological developments in your lifetime have been most pivotal in transforming our experience of the world?</p>

							<p>I’ve lived through two massive changes in the media. The way print mags have been produced and changed by word processors and then computers. And then the way Twitter and Instagram have left email and websites behind.</p>

							<p class="headline">3) What does the future hold – and what transformative technologies do you expect to play a key role in the coming years?</p>

							<p>Everything will just keep getting faster and faster and littered with more and more information and commercial messages. If you’ve any sense you’ll create a way of stepping out of it. Curating what you definitely DO want and not feeling like you’re walking through people’s private conversations and bins to get to things you like.</p>
